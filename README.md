# Poker_NLH_Engine
A work in progress for a Texas No Limit Hold'em poker engine written in java. Currently it can initialize players and their chip amounts, deal cards, determine winning hands and calculate a player's equity (chance to win) on the turn. Currently working on being able to calculate player's equity on the flop and pre-flop.

If you run the Game.java file right now, it will console log the 4 cards on the turn, the two players hands, and what each player's chance to win is.
